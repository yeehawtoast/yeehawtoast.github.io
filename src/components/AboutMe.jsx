              <p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am a software Engineer and system developer with 3+ years of experience in teaching,
                designing, building, and maintaining systems at scale for internal business partners, and for clients abroad.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>I am also passionate about education: I was a distinguished educator, a computer science academic team
              coach, and a league of legends esports coach.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>When I am not working in C# or Go, I am probably supporting business actions in SAP ABAP, or building
                client services on the frontend with Javascript.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>In a previous life, I studied communications and communications theory, employment law, and intersections on comms theory and liberation theology. From this, I have published several papers and occasionally publish a blog related to these ideas</p>
