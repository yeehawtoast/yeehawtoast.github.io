      <h2>Free Computer Science Project</h2>
      <p>Even though professionally I am not an educator anymore, education and teaching is my passion.
      There is nothing I love more than to help students and individuals grow in their knowledge and experience with computer science.
      The current job market is rough, but programming skills are more important than ever as they teach critical reasoning, planning,
      time management, logical reasoning, and improve math skills at all levels. Therefore, I have begun building a site that hopes to compile as much
      information about computer science as possible. This is a large project and is slowly being worked on over time. Feel free to contribute or check back in as I add more material.</p>
      <p>There are also other sub-projects under this larger project:</p>
      <h3>Open Curriculum Project</h3>
      <p>Teachers are bound by knowledge and education standards here in the usa. We often have to share ideas, knowledge, and resources with each other just to get by with teaching students.
      The Open Curriculum Project will hopefully become a repository for lesson plans, videos, resources, and information for teachers and students alike to build a solid foundation in computer science.</p>
      <h3>Practice Client Project</h3>
      <p>The hardest leap from computer science student to software engineer is working with a real client or customer. While many students do internships to help supplement their current knowledge, not everyone has that opprotunity.
      This project will create fake companies with important it business needs that will be delivered in agile form, much like a real company or client. Not only does this give learners a chance to practice their programming skills, but
      also give them some insight into real software development practices used by the largest companies.</p>
      <h2>Project-Based Learning</h2>
      <p>I am a fan of learning by doing, either building things I have never implemented before, or finding ways to refactor existing projects into new languages. Below are some of those projects:</p>
      <p>UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COME BACK LATER ONCE THE SITE LOOKS BETTER</p>
